===========

The FAQ page for my next project

Purpose
-------
I have some project ideas I'm working through in my head, and an important thread that runs through them all is that I want to have good communication with the people who use one of my projects. Communication tools have moved forward a lot in the last decade - and I want to make appropriate use of each of them.

Email
-----
I will ask for your email address. If you don't tell me then... I will probably do something different (less usefully probably).

If you tell me your email I will probably use it at least once. And I will probably use it more than once. It seems like it could be lucrative to sell your email address to someone, but that seems kinda boring - hopefully I can make money in a more interesting way. The fine print: 

- YOU MIGHT GET UNWANTED EMAIL FROM MY PROJECT.
- YOU MIGHT GET UNWANTED EMAIL BECAUSE I MADE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS AVAILABLE TO A 3RD PARTY.
- I DOUBT I COULD HIDE YOUR EMAIL ADDRESS FROM THE NSA OR ANY OTHER HACKERS TRYING TO GET IT.

Twitter
-------
We plan to use twitter extensively, probably tweeting from something like @projectName 

Terms Of Service (TOS)
----------------------
Yeah, I guess we'll have a TOS. Maybe something like:

- WE MAKE NO PROMISES ABOUT ANYTHING. USE OF OUR SERVICE IS AT YOUR OWN RISK.

Status
------
All status updates will be via twitter. If you want it by email you could probably configure twitter to send you an email of the recent staus messages (and if you do figure it out, please send us a tweet about how to do it).

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
--------------------------------
See our github repository, which is probably a fork of https://github.com/JohnB/generic-faq , including the support tickets (which are the expected Q&A with our users).

Support
-------
"Support" is a vague term that usually means "people we pay to help you use our product". Which feels like a bit of an enabler for "areas we can cut costs and no one will notice for a little while". 

Fine Print
----------
You might have some expectations about your relationship with our project. Please see the Terms Of Service (TOS).
